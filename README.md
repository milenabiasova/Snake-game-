# Snake-game-
Overview:
The snake game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a growing snake, navigating it
around the screen to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries. This project
aimed to recreate this nostalgic experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Why This Pathway?
Personal Interest:
I chose this type of the game because I always wanted to create my snake game and with the help of
tutorial, I could achieve this goal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY&t=2478s

Learning Goals:
My primary objective was to enhance my skills in JavaScript, particularly in the realms of DOM
manipulation and event handling. I also wanted to revise fundamental game development concepts like
how to structure functions and collision detection, because these concepts still are not 100%
understandable for me.

Development Process
Initial Planning:
The development started with sketching the game layout and defining the core functionalities: snake
movement, food generation, and score tracking. I wanted to create a game from the scratch, but I was
struggling with the order, and I couldnâ€™t understand where to start, the tutorial really helped me to
understand, put all my knowledge together and structure the project.

Development Stages:
Setting Up the Game Board: I began by creating the grid layout for the game using HTML and CSS.
Implementing Snake Movement: The next step was coding the snake's movement and response to
keyboard inputs.
Adding Food and Scoring: I then added the functionality to place food randomly on the board and
update the score when the snake eats the food.
Game Over Logic: Implementing the logic for the game to end when the snake hits the wall or itself.
Implementing the sound: I finished with implementing the eating sound to my game.

What I Learned
Technical Skills:
JavaScript: Deepened understanding of arrays, objects, functions, collision.
CSS: Learned about complex positioning and styling to create a responsive design.
HTML: Gained experience in structuring a web application.
Difficulties During Development

Technical Challenges:
Ensuring smooth and responsive snake movement.
Implementing a system to increase game difficulty as the score increased.
I was questioning the solutions offered in the tutorial since some of them were unknown for me and I
had difficult time understanding why things work the way they do. After some time, I realized that
starting from the scratch maybe is not the worst idea, because you always know what you are doing and
when I was making my game with tutorial, I needed more time just to understand why we went this way
and not another. Still, it helped me to structure my code and understand some concepts better.

Design Challenges:
Creating a user-friendly interface that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
Creating my own pixel image for the game was fun.

Game Code Overview
Key Functions:
move(): Controls the snake's movement and updates its position.
draw(): Renders the snake and food on the game board.
checkCollision(): Checks for collisions with the game boundaries or the snake itself
